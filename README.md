Dynamic Market Filtering: Dropdown slicers for 'Country' and 'Segment' allow for 1-click recalculation of the entire data model.

Time-Series Analysis: A 'Sales by Month' line chart to track seasonal performance and revenue trends.

Product Performance: Bar chart visualization ranking units sold by product type.

Pricing Strategy Insights: A donut chart analyzing the distribution of units sold across different 'Discount Bands' (High, Medium, Low).

Visual Consistency: Used a unified blue color palette to link revenue trends and product volume.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
